Why do we have prisons? Are they really useful?  
  
I understand that there are people in the society without whom society is a safer place to live in and they need to be deliberately isolated to places such as prisons so that society is safe as a whole.
  
But do our prisons really work?? I understand that there are sadists and psychopaths who gain satisfaction by inflicting pain and suffering on others but I firmly believe that a very large portion of prisoners who fill the prisons today are there due to circumstances, lack of employment, and most importantly lack of education.
  
And we do justice to them?? We fill them up in the prison for a specific period of time and after that their left free in the world again without any substantial change. They are almost the same person as they went in.
  
Here, we forget the root cause of why they committed the crime in the first place. I think the [[Finland model of modern prisons]] is a very very good example that can be replicated and duplicated across the world so that when the prisoners come out they at least have a chance... they at least have the skills by which they can try to change their life... they can try to come into the mainstream and work as respectable individuals.  
  
I am not exactly in favor of "open prisons" and I also understand that the population of Finland is very small as compared to a very populous country like India and we cannot exactly use that model as the number of prisoners is way too large but we can talk about this and somehow develop our own model so that the prisons have an overall positive impact on our society.  
  
Please keep in mind that this system took about 70 years to come to this stage and there is still room for development. It will take a very long period of time for us, no doubt, but it is important to start a conversation.
