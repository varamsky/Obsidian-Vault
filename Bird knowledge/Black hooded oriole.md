Scientific name: Oriolus xanthornus
Local name: पिरोला / हलदी पाखी
Native to: Indian subcontinent and South East Asia

The black head of this species is an obvious distinction from the _Indian golden oriole_, which is a summer visitor to northern India.

The black-hooded oriole lives in common contact with humans in rural and urban India.

A folk tale from Bengal has it that an unfortunate girl of a merchant family was abused and tortured by her mother-in-law. Troubled by various incidents she smeared herself with turmeric paste and covered herself with a sooty earthen pot and killed herself. A goddess resurrected her as a black hooded oriole and a Bengali name for the bird is "__benebou__" or _merchant's wife_ while another name is "__haldi pakhi__" or _turmeric bird_.
