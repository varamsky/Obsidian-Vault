He was the founder of the [[प्रद्योतवंशः (Pradyota Dynasty)]]. [[गौतम बुद्ध (Buddha)]], [[महावीर (Mahavira)]] and [[बिम्बिसार (Bimbisara)]] of the Haryanka Dynasty were his contemporaries.

The Pradyota Dynasty belonged to the [[आभीर / अहीर (Abhira tribe)]]. [[गायत्री (Gāyatrī)]], a Hindu goddess is said to belong to this tribe.

Pradyota also initiated friendly relations with Bimbisāra of the newly rising power of Magadha in the eastern Gangetic plain, and at one point, Pradyota fell ill, and Bimbisāra sent his renowned physician जीवक (Jīvaka) to Avanti to treat Pradyota.

Pradyota engaged in hostilities with the kingdom of [[वत्स (Vatsa)]] against which he carried out an initially successful military campaign until its king Śatānīka was able to repel him. Later, Pradyota captured Udayana in the campaign during which Śatānīka had died. Pradyota married his daughter Vāsavadattā to Udayana, and restored him to the throne of Vatsa, although Udayana henceforth remained under Pradyota's influence.

Following Bimbisāra's son [[अजातशत्रु (Ajātaśatru)]] usurpation of the throne of Magadha after killing his father, and after Ajātaśatru had started a policy of attacking and conquering the Vajjika League, Pradyota took advantage of his control over Vatsa to plan an attack on the Māgadhī capital of Rājagṛha, in response of which Ajātaśatru fortified his capital.

Pradyota reigned for 23 years, and __died on the same day as Mahāvīra's passing__.
