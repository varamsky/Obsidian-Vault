- Her love with [[Kacha]] is described here - [[Kacha, Devayani and Shukracharya]].
- Mentioned in the Adi Parva of [[Mahabharat]], [[Shukracharya]] was an advisor to the [[Danava]] king Vrisaparva. One day, Vrisaparva's daughter [[Sharmishtha]] and [[Devayani]] went to bath in a forest pool. After the bath as [[Sharmishtha]] mistakenly wears [[Devayani]]'s clothes, she is scolded and [[Devayani]] insults her saying that Vrishparva and his kingdom lives on her father's blessings. Angered by this slur on her father [[Sharmishtha]] with the help of other asura girls throws the naked [[Devayani]] into a well, later to be saved by [[Yayati]]. Angered by this [[Devayani]] asks [[Sharmishtha]] and other asura girls to serve her as maid which is agreed by Vrisaparva as he didn't want to offend [[Shukracharya]]. 
- Later when [[Devayani]] and [[Yayati]] are married she finds out that he was cheating on her with [[Sharmishtha]]. She leaves him and returns to her father. Learning about this [[Shukracharya]] curses [[Yayati]].
