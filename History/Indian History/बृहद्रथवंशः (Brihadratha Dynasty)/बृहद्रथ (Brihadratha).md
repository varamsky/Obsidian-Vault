बृहद्रथ (Brihadratha), also called Maharatha, was the founder of the [[बृहद्रथवंशः (Brihadratha Dynasty)]].

The name is a combination of _बृहत् (bṛhat) meaning 'great' or 'huge'_, and _रथ (ratha) meaning 'chariot'_. Therefore, the name बृहद्रथ (Bṛhadratha) can be assumed to be meaning "someone with a great/huge chariot".

[[मगध (Magadha)]] was established by him on the banks of river Ganga, thus transferring the centre of power from Chedi, a neighbouring kingdom, to the newly settled Magadha.

He had a daughter named Shashirekha who was the second wife of [[धृष्टद्युम्न (Dhrishtadyumna)]].

Brihadratha was the eldest of the five sons of [[वसु (Vasu)]], (also known as [[उपरिचर वसु (Uparichara Vasu)]]) the [[कुरु (Kuru)]] king of Chedi and his queen Girika.

All the Puranas mention his sister Amna, as his successor. Whereas, scholars believe his son [[जरासन्ध (Jarasandha)]] to be his successor.
