Indian history(northern parts) after the [[महाभारत (Mahabharata)]] starts from the various dynasties in the area of Magadha during, what is generally called as the Later Vedic Period.

The महाजनपद (Mahajanapada) gradually made way to the establishment of मगध (Magadha) as the strongest political power at the time and started the बृहद्रथ वंश (Brihadratha Dynasty).

The chronological listing of the मगध empires are listed below:

- [[बृहद्रथवंशः (Brihadratha Dynasty)]]
- [[प्रद्योतवंशः (Pradyota Dynasty)]]
- [[हर्यङ्कवंशः (Haryanka Dynasty)]]
- [[शिशुनागवंशः (Shishunaga Dynasty)]]
- नन्दवंशः
- मौर्यवंशः
- शुङ्गवंशः
- कन्ववंशः

__Here, I have mentioned [[प्रद्योतवंशः (Pradyota Dynasty)]] as the successor dynasty after the [[बृहद्रथवंशः (Brihadratha Dynasty)]] whereas [Mahabharat is history; Brihadratha Dynasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5FPyKxUFjo) mentions the [[हर्यङ्कवंशः (Haryanka Dynasty)]] as the successor dynasty.__
