Predecessor - Vishwajit
Successor - [[प्रद्योत (Pradyota)]]

The last of the [[बृहद्रथवंशः (Brihadratha Dynasty)]] was Ripunjaya, who was killed by a minister named Punika (Pulika). After the death of Ripunjaya, Punika placed his own son Pradyota on throne and founded the [[प्रद्योतवंशः (Pradyota Dynasty)]] in 682 BCE.

__Here, I have mentioned [[प्रद्योतवंशः (Pradyota Dynasty)]] as the successor dynasty after the [[बृहद्रथवंशः (Brihadratha Dynasty)]] whereas [Mahabharat is history; Brihadratha Dynasty](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5FPyKxUFjo) mentions the [[हर्यङ्कवंशः (Haryanka Dynasty)]] as the successor dynasty.__
