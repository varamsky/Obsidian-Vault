समकालीन वंश (Contemporary dynasty) - [[हर्यङ्कवंशः (Haryanka Dynasty)]]

__The Pradyota dynasty was mainly the rulers of Avanti__. [[गौतम बुद्ध]], [[वर्धमान महावीर]] and [[बिम्बिसार (Bimbisara)]] of the Haryanka Dynasty were its contemporaries.

[[शिशुनाग (Shishunaga)]] of the Shishunaga Dynasty killed the last ruler. This brought to an end the hundred year old rivalry between Magadh and Avanti. From then Avanti became a part of Magadh.
