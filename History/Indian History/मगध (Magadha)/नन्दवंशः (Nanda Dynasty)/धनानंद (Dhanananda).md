He was the last ruler of the [[नन्दवंशः (Nanda Dynasty)]].

The Buddhist tradition states that Dhana Nanda insulted the [[चाणक्य]], ordering him to be thrown out of the assembly. Chanakya vowed to de-throne him and establish a better and just empire. Consequently, he was dethroned by [[चन्द्रगुप्त मौर्य (Chandragupta Maurya)]] of the [[मौर्यवंशः (Maurya Dynasty)]].

All historical accounts agree that the last Nanda king was unpopular among his subjects. According to Diodorus, [[Porus]] told [[Alexander]] that the contemporary Nanda king was a man of "worthless character", and was not respected by his subjects as he was thought to be of low origin.
