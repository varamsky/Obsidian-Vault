Predecessor - [[शिशुनागवंशः (Shishunaga Dynasty)]]
Successor - [[मौर्यवंशः (Maurya Dynasty)]]

This dynasty was found after eliminating the Shishunaga Dynasty.

The Nandas built on the successes of their Haryanka and Shaishunaga predecessors, and instituted a more centralised administration. Ancient sources credit them with amassing great wealth, which was probably a result of introduction of new currency and taxation system. Ancient texts also suggest that the Nandas were unpopular among their subjects because of their low status birth, _excessive taxation_, and their general _misconduct_.

The Buddhist, Jain, and Puranic traditions all state that there were _9 Nanda kings_, but the sources differ considerably on the names of these kings.
