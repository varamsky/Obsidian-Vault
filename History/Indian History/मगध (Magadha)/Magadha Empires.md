Indian history(northern parts) after the [[महाभारत (Mahabharata)]] starts from the various dynasties in the area of Magadha during, what is generally called as the Later Vedic Period.

The महाजनपद (Mahajanapada) gradually made way to the establishment of मगध (Magadha) as the strongest political power at the time and started the बृहद्रथ वंश (Brihadratha Dynasty).
