He was also known as उदायिभद्र.

Udayin laid the foundation of the city of पाटलिपुत्र at the confluence of two rivers, the Son and the Ganges. The city has been called as कुसुमपुर / पुष्पपुर in the texts which where other names for the Pataliputra. He shifted his capital from Rajagriha to Pataliputra due to the latter's central location in the empire.

Buddhist chronicles state that all the kings from [[अजातशत्रु (Ajātaśatru)]] to [[नागदशक (Nagadasaka)]], including Udayin, killed their fathers that is why they are called _पितृहन्ता वंश_.
But, Jain texts don't mention any such thing.
