He is called श्रेणिक(Shrenika) in the Puranas.

He was the founder of the [[हर्यङ्कवंशः (Haryanka Dynasty)]]. Bimbisara was the son of Bhattiya, a chieftain. He was placed on the throne at the age of 15 by his father.

His first wife Kosala Devi was the sister of प्रसेनजित(Prasenjit), the king of Kosala.
He was also in love with [[आम्रपाली]] of [[वैशाली (Vaishali)]].

He led a military campaign against Anga, perhaps to avenge his father's earlier defeat at the hands of its king, Brahmadatta. The campaign was successful, Anga was annexed, and prince Kunika (Ajatashatru) was appointed governor at Champa.

As per Buddhism, due to influence by Dustabandu Divadatt (a Buddhist monk), Bimbisara was assassinated by his son Ajatashatru, who then succeeded him to the throne. Bimbisara named Ajatashatru as his successor but the prince didn't want to wait for his father's death so he killed him.

As per Jainism, Bimbisara was imprisoned by Ajatashatru because the prince to become the king. However, when he came to know that Bimbisara had already named him as the successor he rushed to free his father but by that time Bimbisara had committed suicide.

In the Jain literature it is written, that he will be reborn as _Mahapadma_ (sometimes called _Padmanabha_), the first in the chain of future tirthankaras who are to rise at the beginning of the upward motion (_Utsarpini_) of the next era of time.
