The country of Vatsa was very rich and prosperous and noted for the high quality of its cotton fabrics. कौशाम्बी (Kaushambi) was it's capital.

_Udayana_ (Udena) was a very powerful king and a number of interesting legends centre rounds his rivalry with king Pradyota of Avanti.

He is the hero of three dramas, [[स्वप्नवासवदत्तम् (Svapnavāsavadattam)]] of Bhasa and _Priyadarsika_ and _Ratnavali_ of _Harsha_, and we know from Meghadutam of [[कालिदास (Kalidasa)]], that even in the time of this poet many stories about Udayana were widely current in Avanti.
