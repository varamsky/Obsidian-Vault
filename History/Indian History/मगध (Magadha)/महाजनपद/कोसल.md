The conquest of Kasi made Kosala a powerful state. It soon extended its supremacy over the Sakyas of Kapilavastu. Its king _Prasenajit_ or Pasenadi, a contemporary of [[गौतम बुद्ध|Buddha]] figures as one of the most important rulers of the time. He carried on a protracted struggle with [[अजातशत्रु (Ajātaśatru)|Ajatashatru]], king of Magadha.

Although not definitely converted to Buddhism, Prasenajit was a great admirer of the Buddha, and the Buddhist texts record many conversations between the two. His admiration extended also to the [[Sakya]] clan, in which the Master was born, and he asked for a daughter of a Sakya chief as his wife. The Sakyas, too proud of their lineage to enter into such an alliance, but too weak to refuse openly the request of such a powerful potentate in their immediate neighbourhood, had resort to a trick. The offspring of a Sakya chief by a slave girl was passed off as the legitimate daughter of the Sakya race and married to Prasenajit. A son, _विडूडभ (Vidudabha)_, was born of this marriage, and when he paid a visit to his maternal grandfather the true origin of his mother came to light. It naturally created a great sensation, and Prasenajit discarded both his queen and son. But the great Buddha told him that whatever might have been the origin of the queen, the son belonged to the caste of his father, and on his advice Prasenajit restored both the queen and the prince to favour.

Once while he was talking with the Buddha in the Sakya country, the minister, who was left in charge of the kingdom, proclaimed prince Vidudabha as king. Prasenajit, being deserted by his people, proceeded towards Rajagriha to secure the help of Ajatasatru. But weary and worn out, he reached that city only to die outside its gates. Such was the miserable end of a great career highly extolled in the Buddhist texts.

Vidudabha, who succeeded him, invaded the Sakya country and massacred the Sakya clan, sparing neither men nor women and children. Though many escaped, it was the virtual end of the famous autonomous clan which produced one of the greatest teaehefs the world has seen. The fraud practised by the Sakyas in respect of his mother is represented to be the cause of his wrath, though there might have been political reasons or other factors. Nothing else is known of Vidudabha or the kingdom of Kosala after him.
