He was the founder of the [[मौर्यवंशः (Maurya Dynasty)]].

Like that of many other great figures in history the early career of Chandragupta is involved in obscurity. According to the Greek writer Justin, he was a man of low origin. The Jain tradition also represents him as a son of a village headman’s daughter, and adds, by way of explaining the title Maurya, that the village was inhabited by _peacock-tamers (mayura-poshaka)_.The Brahmanical describe him as base-born, while the Buddhist represent him as belonging to a Kshatriya ruling clan.

When [[Alexander]] was on the banks of river Beas having won the land of India that lay on the west of Beas, his army is said to have revolted and he had to give up his dream of world conquer and retreat. Meanwhile, Chandragupta along with Chanakya was planning to free India from the foreign invaders as well as the tyranny of [[धनानंद (Dhanananda)]]. Therefore, he slowly started re-capturing the areas won by Alexander.

Alexander died in 323 BCE. The two years, 325-323 B.C., that intervened between the death of Philippus and that of his master(Alexander), were eventful years of his preparation for the final blow. Chandragupta’s fight against the Macedonians, must have begun considerably earlier. The most reasonable explanation seems to be that Chandragupta had begun the war of liberation, probably in the Lower Sindhu valley, before 321 or even before 323 BCE. His date of accession may be provisionally fixed at 324 BCE.

Having restored some of the regions won by Alexander, he defeated Magadha. Not much detail is found about how he defeated the Nandas but the famous __'a child putting his finger into the middle of a hot pie, instead of starting from the edge which was cool'__ is mentioned in Jain texts. Similar explanations are available in Buddhist texts as well. All this suggested that he first attacked the center of Magadha and was defeated. Then, having learnt his lesson the hard way, he started capturing the frontiers and gradually gained control of the whole of Magadha.

While Chandragupta was busy laying the foundations of his empire in India, the Greek king [[Seleucus]], who had succeeded Alexander in the eastern part of his empire, was moving towards India to recover the lost possessions of the late emperor. But while Alexander had to fight against a divided India, split up into a multitude of states, his successor had to face a united and a much stronger India organised by an able leader. The Greek writers do not give the details of his conflict with Chandragupta, but merely record the result. Seleucus had to purchase peace by ceding to Chandragupta territories then known as Aria, Arachosia, and Paropanisadae (the capitals of which were respectively the cities now known as _Herat_, _Kandahar_ and _Kabul_), and probably also a part of Gedrosia (_Baluchistan_). In return Chandragupta presented him with 500 war elephants. His defeat and discomfiture at the hands of an Indian ruler would naturally be passed over by Greek writers, and their silence goes decidedly against Seleucus. The peace was ratified by a matrimonial alliance between the rival parties. This has been generally taken to mean that Chandragupta married a daughter of Seleucus, but this is not warranted by known facts. Henceforth, Seleucus maintained friendly relations with the Mauryan Court and sent [[Megasthenes]] as his ambassador who lived in Pataliputra for a long time and wrote a book on India.
