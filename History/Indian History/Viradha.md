- Also called [[Tumbaru]] from a previous life

- Minor character in [[Valmiki Ramayanam - Aranyakanda]] (Sarga 3) where he briefly kidnaps Sita which "has been described as "strongly (prefiguring Sita's) later abduction by Ravana". This episode of [[Viradha]] is also mentioned in [[Valmiki Ramayanam - Balakanda]] 1.1.41
- [[Rama]] and [[Lakshman]] initially cannot hurt him because though they shoot it with many arrows, the arrows pass straight through him and leave him unharmed. Later the monster reveals about a boon from [[Brahma]] making him invincible to weapons.
- He in his previous life has been said to be a गन्धर्व / [[Gandharva]] named तुम्बरु / [[Tumbaru]]. He is a very important gandharva and is said to lead the gandarvas in singing.
- [[Tumbaru]] once offended [[Kubera]] by not bringing [[Rambha]] before [[Kubera]] at the stipulated time. Enraged, [[Kubera]] cursed him to be born as a राक्षस / [[Rakshasa]](demon). [[Kubera]] also decreed that [[Tumbaru]] would be freed from the curse when [[Rama]] would slay him.
