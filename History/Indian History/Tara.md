- Husband - [[Brihaspati]]
- Children - [[Kacha]] [[Budha]]

Her affair with [[Chandra]] is mentioned in [[Padma Purana]] as तारकामय युद्ध / Tarakamaya Yudha.

As [[Brihaspati]] was very busy with helping the Devas she felt ignored by her husband. When she saw [[Chandra]] they felt attracted and eventually eloped. This led to war between [[Asura]]'s and Devas as [[Chandra]] was assisted by [[Shukracharya]] and the [[Asura]]s whereas [[Brihaspati]] was aided by [[Indra]] and the devas, allied with the [[Yaksha]]s.

It led to a lot of bloodshed. Indra is stated to have slain [[Virochana]], the son of [[Prahlada]] who had sided with [[Chandra]](also called Soma). The [[Brahmanda Purana]] states that [[Vishnu]] participated in the war as well, slaying the asura [[Kalanemi]].

Finally, [[Brahma]] intervened and asked [[Tara]] to return to [[Brihaspati]]. But when she gave birth to [[Budha]] everyone was unsure whose child he was as both [[Brihaspati]] and [[Chandra]] claimed him as their child. Finally, [[Tara]] clarified by stating that he was the son of [[Chandra]].
