- We know that the Devas and [[Asura]]s are eternally at war with each other, symbolising the eternal struggle between good and evil.
- The Devas has [[Brihaspati]] as their guru whereas the [[Asura]]s had [[Shukracharya]] as their guru. [[Shukracharya]] knew something that [[Brihaspati]] didn't. He knew about Mrit Sanjivani, a technique to revive the dead.
- So, no matter how many [[Asura]]s the Devas killed they were always resurrected from death by [[Shukracharya]]. Thus, they went to [[Brihaspati]] for help. He admitted that he couldn't do much so they asked [[Kacha]], his son, for help.
- Therefore, according to the plan [[Kacha]] went to [[Shukracharya]]'s ashram as a student. [[Shukracharya]] accepted him and he started living and studying there. Now, [[Shukracharya]] had a daughter named [[Devayani]]. [[Kacha]] and [[Devayani]] became good friends overtime and [[Devayani]] started falling for him(she didn't propose him yet thinking that she'll do it after his studies are completed).
- Meanwhile, the [[Asura]]s were skeptical of [[Kacha]]'s presence in the ashram and suspected foul play. They feared that if he learned the art of Mrit Sanjivani then they'll lose their edge over the Devas. Therefore, they decided to kill him.
- One day when [[Kacha]] was nowhere to be found [[Devayani]] feared the worst and asked her father for help stating her love for him and that she won't live without him.
- [[Shukracharya]] located [[Kacha]] and found that he's dead. Out of his affection for his brilliant student and his love for his daughter, he resurrected him using Mrit Sanjivani knowledge.
- Angered at this the [[Asura]]s tried numerous other ways to kill him but everytime he way brought back by [[Shukracharya]]. Once the [[Asura]]s killed him and fed his body to a dog. But again [[Shukracharya]] saved him and [[Kacha]] re-emerged from inside the dog's stomach tearing the dog apart.
- At last, the [[Asura]]s devised a plan to end it forever. They after killing [[Kacha]] burnt him and mixed his ash in alcohol. Now, his alcohol was consumed by [[Shukracharya]]. The same story repeated, [[Devayani]] grew tensed after not able to find [[Kacha]] so she requested her father again. This time [[Shukracharya]] found out that [[Kacha]] was inside his stomach. He thought of resurrecting him back but realised that [[Kacha]] would re-emerge tearing out his stomach(just like the dog earlier) and thus he([[Shukracharya]]) would die.
- At last he decided to teach [[Kacha]] the art of Mrit Sanjivani. Thus, when he emerged from [[Shukracharya]]'s stomach he used the same knowledge to bring [[Shukracharya]] back to life.
- Now, as his mission of finding about Mrit Sanjivani was complete, after some days he decided to leave the ashram.
- At this [[Devayani]] confessed her love and asked him to marry her. [[Kacha]] said that as he emerged from [[Shukracharya]]'s stomach, in a way he is her brother and so he can't marry her.
- Angered at his treachery, [[Devayani]] cursed him at the crucial time he will forget about the Mrit Sanjivani art. [[Kacha]] simply said that he'll teach the other Devas how to use this art. [[Kacha]] also angry at being cursed for no fault of his cursed [[Devayani]] that she marry out of the Brahmin community.
- Â From his father's and Deva's point of view, he was a successful spy or warrior; from [[Devayani]]'s point of view- he was a lover who betrayed her.
