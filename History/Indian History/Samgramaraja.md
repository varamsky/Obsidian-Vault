### Battle against Mahmud of Ghazni
- In 1014, [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] attacked the Kabul Shahi(Hindu Shahi) kingdom. The Kabul Shahi ruler **Trilochanapala** appealed to [[Samgramaraja]] for assistance against Mahmud. [[Samgramaraja]] responded by sending a large army under his commander-in-chief, Tunga to aid **Trilochanapala**. *In the ensuing battle, **Trilochanapala was defeated**.*
- Antagonized by [[Samgramaraja]]'s having helped **Trilochanapala**, *Mahmud invaded Kashmir*. He advanced along the Tohi river valley, planning to enter Kashmir through the Tosamaidan pass. However, his advanced was checked by the strong **fort of Loharkot**. After having besieged the fort for a month, *Mahmud abandoned the siege and retreated*, losing many of his troops on his way and almost losing his own life as well. *In 1021, Mahmud again attempted to invade Kashmir, but was again not able to advance beyond the Loharkot fort.* After the two failed invasion attempts, he did not attempt to invade Kashmir again.
