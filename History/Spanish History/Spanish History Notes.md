- [[Heritage Sites in Spain]]
- After Spain came under Roman rule, around 200 BCE, the region was named Hispania, based on the earlier Phoenician name Sp(a)n or Spania.
- Many Germanic tribes migrated from middle Europe to the Iberian Peninsula. Eventually, the [[Visigoths]] forcibly integrated all remaining independent territories in the peninsula.
	- Visigoths were also Germanic tribes. Visigoth migration paths : [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visigoth_migrations.jpg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Visigoth_migrations.jpg)
- In the early 8th century the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by the Umayyad Islamic Caliphate, which arrived in the peninsula in the year 711, forming Al-Andalus. The handful of small Christian pockets in the north were left out of Muslim rule, due to the presence and support of the Carolingian Empire(French empire).
- There are large populations of [[Romani]] in Spain who live in poor conditions and are subjected to prejudice labeling them as prone to commit petty thefts and other crimes.
