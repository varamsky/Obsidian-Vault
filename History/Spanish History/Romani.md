Romani are a group of people who migrated from Northern India in about 512 CE and settled in Middle East and Europe(mainly Spain, Romania, France, Scandinavia..). In Spain, they are called gitano, which evolved from the word egiptano("Egyptian"). They are also often called gypsies, which makes people think of them as living a vagabond like irregular life, but it isn't entirely true.

According to a legend in the Persian epic poem Shahnameh, from Iran, a Sasanian king learned that the poor couldn't enjoy music so he asked the king of India to send him 10,000 luris(lute players). When he received them, he gave each of them an oxen, donkey and donkey-load of wheat so that they could sustain on agriculture and play music for free. But, the luris ate the oxen and wheat and returned with donkeys and empty stomachs. Angered by this the persian king ordered to pack up and go wander away on donkeys.
