It is sometimes used to make cheap furniture and village dwellings, though it is relatively hard for carpentry. Besides the fruits, wood from _neredu_ tree (as it is called Telugu) is used in Andhra Pradesh to make bullock cart wheels and other agricultural equipment. The timber is used to construct doors and windows.
