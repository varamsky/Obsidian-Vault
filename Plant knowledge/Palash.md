Palash is  the State Flower of Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.

Historically, Palash originated in Bihar and Jharkhand. Dhak forests covered much of the Doaba area between the Ganga and Yamuna, but these were cleared for agriculture in the early 19th century as the [[English East India Company]] increased tax demands on the peasants.

## Uses
1. The flowers are used to prepare a traditional Holi colour called "Kesari".
2. This tree provides the leaves that are used either with many pieced together or singly (only in case of a banana leaf) to make a leaf-plate for serving a meal.
3. Very crucial in the day-to-day practise of a number of Hindu rituals.
