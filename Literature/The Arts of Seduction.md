## Fleeting Notes
1. "What makes the Kama Sutra stand out from other similar texts is that in compiling the book, [[Vatsyayan]] did what no one had ever done before— he broke the ultimate gender myth. For centuries religious belief had held that a woman did not have an independent source of pleasure, that her pleasure depended on that of the man—in other words, a woman’s orgasm was the result of a man’s orgasm. The [[Kama Sutra]] stated that not only do women have an independent source of pleasure but that a man is not even necessary to the process.", page 9
2. "Men’s desires are like fire, starting at the genitals and moving up to the brain. They are easy to ignite and equally quick to extinguish. They need very little encouragement to arrive at full arousal and are content with instant gratification. Women’s desires are like water, starting at the head and flowing downwards; and like water they take far longer to come to the boil and equally long to cool down.", page 11
3. "..a man who is culturally well informed, the one who can stimulate your mind is the most attractive man of all.", page 11
4. "..we are the only culture in which [[Cupid]] (or Eros) doesn’t have a physical body—he is ananga.", page 11
5. "..as part of the making up, the man is supposed to fall at her feet, and it was forbidden for a man to fall at a woman’s feet outdoors. This law was outlined by the sage [[Dattaka]] who, according to legend, created the rules of etiquette for social and sexual manners to be followed by lovers and courtesans.", page 21
6. "...a common trope in ancient Indian literature and the arts was the ‘girdle of jingling bells’. It was not the norm for a woman to be on top during sex. For her to be on top, she had to be an exceptionally good lover—that is, she had to be good enough to bring herself and her partner to orgasm by only moving her hips. Not the torso, just the hips! And so, the really accomplished courtesans would wear a girdle of ghungroos around their upper waist and make sure that during sex none of the bells made a sound!", page 25
7. "[[Vatsyayan]] begins his chapter on the love codes with a grim warning to men who underestimate the importance of understanding these codes (as opposed to women, who clearly get their significance). He says a man can be rich, good looking and skilled in all the other sixty-three arts of love, but if he has no knowledge of the secret love codes then the woman of his dreams will dump him in the same way that one discards a wilted garland of flowers—in the garbage, without a second thought.", page 25
8. "For instance, Bihari (a seventeenth-century poet) tells us, ‘It was a religious festival. As the priests sit around the prayer fire he (our hero) picks up a lotus flower and looking at her (our heroine) touches the flower to his head. In response she lifts up her aarsi (ring with a mirror in the centre) and catching his reflection as well as the reflection of the sun in it, she puts it to her breast. He smiles and is content.’

   The flower to the head means ‘charan kamal’ or ‘your lotus feet’. A man would only have the woman’s feet on his head after they made love (i.e. they are lovers). When our hero touches the lotus to his head after looking at his beloved, he is begging his lover to meet him that night. When she catches his reflection in her mirror ring, she is agreeing to meet with him. Catching the sun and then ‘placing’ it to her breast signifies that she will meet him after the sun has gone to rest in his mountain home.", page 26
