## Fleeting Notes
1. "What makes the Kama Sutra stand out from other similar texts is that
in compiling the book, [[Vatsyayan]] did what no one had ever done before—
he broke the ultimate gender myth. For centuries religious belief had held
that a woman did not have an independent source of pleasure, that her
pleasure depended on that of the man—in other words, a woman’s orgasm
was the result of a man’s orgasm. The [[Kama Sutra]] stated that not only do
women have an independent source of pleasure but that a man is not even
necessary to the process.", page 9
2. "Men’s desires are like fire, starting at the genitals and moving up to
the brain. They are easy to ignite and equally quick to extinguish. They
need very little encouragement to arrive at full arousal and are content with
instant gratification. Women’s desires are like water, starting at the head and
flowing downwards; and like water they take far longer to come to the boil
and equally long to cool down.", page 11
3. "..a man who is culturally well informed, the one who can stimulate your mind is the most attractive man of all.", page 11
4. "..we are the only culture in which Cupid (or Eros) doesn’t have a physical body—he is ananga.", page 11
