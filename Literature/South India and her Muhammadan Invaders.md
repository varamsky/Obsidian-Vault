## Fleeting Notes
1. "The four kingdoms of the Peninsula - India south of the Vindhyas in the last decade of the thirteenth century and the first of the fourteenth was thus divided into four well- marked kingdoms. The first was, as was stated above, the Yādava kingdom of Devagiri with its Capital at Devagiri (Deogir). It was ruled by the last great Yadava, Rāma- chandra, who ascended the throne in A.D. 1271 and ruled till some time in A.D. 1309-10. The eastern half of the Dekhan and the Telingana coast was under Queen Rudrāmba of the Kākatīya dynasty with Capital at Warangal in the Nizam's Dominions. Sometime in A.D. 1291 she raised her grandson Pratāpa Rudra to the throne and retired. Pratāpa Rudra ruled from A.D. 1291 to A.D. 1328. ..... All north of the first line roughly belonged to the Hoysalas and all south to the Pandyas; the more open country along the coast right up to Nellore on the great Madura-Madras road, was a debatable frontier between these two powers. The last great ruler of the united Hoysala empire was Vira Ballāļa III who succeeded his father Narasimha III in A.D. 1291-2 and ruled till his death in A.D. 1342. He was succeeded by a son Ballāļa IV, who perhaps ruled for three years more. All through this period the kingdom of the Pandyas in the south was held by a remarkably gifted ruler who gave the country peace and prosperity. This was Märavarman Kulaśēkhara I, whose forty-fourth year we have records of. He ascended the throne in A.D. 1268 and ruled till sometime in A.D. 1311-2. The dissensions between his two sons brought in the Muhammadan intervention which took the form of the first Muhammadan invasion of the south.", page 68
