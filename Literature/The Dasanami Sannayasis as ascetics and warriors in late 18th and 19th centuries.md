## My thoughts
- When I saw [[Laal Kaptaan]] my first thoughts were how and WHY should a Naga Sannayasi be involved in armed conflicts. Their interference with "worldly matters" seemed to destroy the whole purpose of leading an ascetic life. 
- There has always been the discussion of Grihasta vs Sannyas. We have seen it with the famous [[Adi Shankaracharya]] vs [[Mandan Mishra]] debate. I think that this is also a similar debate where the Sannayasis at a particular time would have had the idea that they can attain [[Moksha]] even as Grihasta, even after marrying and having a family and being involved in worldly matters.
- There can also be this view that to protect [[Sanatan Dharma]] against invaders they took this violent approach similar to the formation of [[Khalsa]] by [[Guru Gobind Singh]].
- The male:female ratio of the Sannayasis was well balanced throughout India. I always assumed that female participation in such groups would be very little but found the contrary details in the journal.
- This group of people may have been formed with a definite and positive intent but there later actions make it clear that they did not do anything for or against any community, their actions were often selfish and not caring for any greater common goal.

## Fleeting notes
- "**Conclusion** There is not denying the fact that the Sannayasis were a religious groups of people who in course of time had involved in mercenery activities, trade and money-lending. Their activities continued in all India perspectives till the second half of the nineteenth century particularly before the establishment of colonial rule in India. These groups of people maintained their ascetic way of life even today. The Sannayasis' participation in [[Kumbha Mela]] or in the fair of Ganga Sagar is still evident and their akharas are still in existence in almost all over India.", page 588
