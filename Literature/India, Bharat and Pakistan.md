## Fleeting Notes
1. "In popular discourse, the Partition of Bengal in 1905 on religious lines by the British is credited with sowing the seeds of the idea of Pakistan. This has created the false impression of communal harmony having existed between Hindus and Muslims prior to the employment of the so-called divide and rule policy by the British in 1905. While British motivations behind the Partition of Bengal and their subsequent hand in nurturing the idea of Pakistan must and will be examined in some detail, an exclusive focus on British machinations creates the erroneous notion of Hindus and Muslims being equal victims of British rule, drawing attention away from express attempts to restore Islamic rule over Bharat. It bears noting that an Anglocentric approach, which gives Middle Eastern coloniality a free pass in the context of Bharat’s Partition, is largely a product of the postcolonial school; this, therefore, reinforces the need for a decolonial approach to Bharat’s history to prevent the sugar-coating of facts with generous dollops of postcolonial secularisation.", page 25
2. "In the words of Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, the following was Dehlawi’s conception of Islam:<br><br>The reason which prompted Allah to create the Islamic community originally was, according to Shah, mainly a political one. Allah wished that no religion superior to Islam should exist on earth and that Islamic law including those regarding different forms of punishment, should be adhered to wherever people lived a communal life. In this regard, he stated that the chief reason for fixing the blood-money for killing an infidel at half that of killing a Muslim was necessary in order to firmly establish the superiority of the latter; moreover, the slaughter of infidels, diminished evil amongst Muslims.", page 32
3. "As someone who considered Mahmud of Ghazni as Islam’s greatest ruler for having launched and sustained the first real conquest of northern Bharat, Dehlawi could not bear to watch the Mughal ‘empire’ under the licentious and un-Islamic Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1725–1775) survive only at the mercy of the Marathas. Here is a sample of his Islamic proposals to the Mughal dynast Ahmad Shah Bahadur, which went unheeded, much to Dehlawi’s angst:<br><br>Strict orders must be issued in all Islamic towns forbidding religious ceremonies publicly practised by the Infidels (such as Holi and ritual bathing in the Ganges). On the tenth of Muharram Shiís should not be allowed to go beyond the bounds of moderation and in the bazaars and streets neither should they be rude nor repeat stupid things (that is, recite tabarra or condemn the first three successors of Muhammad).<br><br>Notice how Shias, for whom Dehlawi had no love lost, could celebrate their festivals in public but in moderation, whereas Hindus had no right whatsoever to celebrate their festivals in public.", page 36
4. "According to Ayesha Jalal, Shariatullah, like Dehlawi, was an admirer of Arab culture, so much so that he ordered his followers to eat grasshoppers since they resembled the locusts eaten by his Arab co-religionists.", page 40
5. "Fortunately for him, his vehement call for practice of Islam in its purest form and for complete abandonment of Indian accretions which had arisen as a product of Muslims’ interactions with the infidels (namely the Hindus) found significant traction among Rohilla Muslims, who flocked to him in vast numbers. This was not surprising, considering that Najib-ud-Daula too was a Rohilla Pathan and the Third Battle of Panipat had taken place barely sixty years earlier. In case there existed an ‘Indian version’ of Islam and if there indeed was a Ganga–Jamuni tehzeeb, it was looked down upon and rejected by influential members of the Muslim community since the syncretism was largely the product of the Hindu ancestry of the converts. This means that what passes off as syncretism was and remains significantly the product of a nouveau convert unable to let go of his Hindu roots, which cannot be construed as Islam having acquired a distinct Bharatiya flavour or as revealing its malleability upon contact with Bharat. In any case, this ‘syncretic culture’ was given up by the masses, or at least by a significant number of them, at the first call to return to Islam 1.0, the din, the ‘true religion’. So much for ‘Indian Islam’.", page 45
6. "Thus began a series of bloody battles, starting with the Battle of Akora between the Wahhabis under Syed Shahid Ahmad Barelvi and the Sikhs under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which would go on until the annexation of Punjab by the British in 1847—i.e., even after Ranjit Singh’s death in 1839 and after Barelvi’s death in 1831 at the Battle of Balakot", page 49
7. "This passage also underscores the historical significance of the surgical airstrikes undertaken by the Indian Air Force in Balakot in 2019 in response to the Pulwama suicide bombing. That the seeds for this terror network were sown by Barelvi in the 1800s needs to be pointed out, given the present-day tendency to look at certain incidents in isolation instead of identifying the existence of a thought continuum. Interestingly, the followers of Barelvi have not forgotten their history, whereas those who were the object of hatred of Barelvi and his mujahidin seem to suffer from a short memory. Ultimately, history tends to reward those with a long collective memory.", page 51
8. "According to Ayesha Jalal, Raza Khan is reported to have said that if a Muslim were presented the choice of offering water to a thirsty infidel or to a dog, he should offer it to the latter. He rejected the use of armed jihad against the British since the religious freedoms of Muslims remained unaffected under them.", page 82
9. "To support his British loyalist position further, Nawab Abdul Latif cited British support to the Ottoman empire in the Crimean War against the Russian empire, the cordial relations between the British and Ottoman Egypt, and the dependence of the Emir of Afghanistan on the British. He even obtained a fatwa from the Mufti of Mecca that Bharat was Dar al-Islam under the British and had 5,000 copies of the fatwa distributed among Muslims in Bengal through the Mohammedan Literary Society. In 1877, for his promotion of English education among Muslims, he was bestowed the title of ‘Khan Bahadur’ by the British.", page 94
10. "With a view to tip the balance and increase the Islamic quotient in the education of Muslim youth, institutions such as the Darul Uloom Nadwatul Ulama and the Jamia Millia Islamia were later established in 1898 and 1920, respectively.", page 94
11. "Khan’s father, Syed Ahmed Takki, who was a close friend of the then Mughal ‘Emperor’ Akbar II, was offered prime ministership, which he declined. After Takki’s death in 1836, the then (and last) Mughal ‘Emperor’ Bahadur Shah Zafar bestowed upon Syed Ahmed Khan the titles of his grandfather and additional titles. No wonder Barbara Metcalf makes it abundantly clear that Syed Ahmed Khan was ‘acutely sensitive’ to the loss of Mughal power and was keen on restoring the pride of the Muslim ruling class and nobility, a vision consistent with Dehlawi’s.", page 98
12. "Prior to the Mutiny of 1857, this so-called modern Islamic reformer subscribed to traditional Islamic positions even in matters of science, as evidenced by his monograph of 1850 titled Qaul-i-matin dar ibtal-i harakat-i zamin (‘Firm Assertion with Regard to the False Motion of the Earth’), wherein he denied the earth’s rotation.17 Given his family’s proximity to the Mughal dynasty, his training in the Dehlawite school of thought and his unambiguous Quranic views on matters of science, it is not possible to believe that the Two-Nation Theory was an aberration from Khan’s central worldview. On the contrary, it was entirely consistent with it, as we shall see, and any statement made by Khan to the contrary at any point in his life must, in fact, be seen as his pragmatism at work, which made no difference to the Dehlawite end goal. This pragmatism is evident from the fact that when the Wahhabis started directing their jihad towards the British after the latter’s annexation of Punjab, Khan could no longer afford to be as open in his adulation of the Wahhabis. Therefore, he redacted the above extracted paragraph from the very same book in 1854.", page 99
13. "The following were Khan’s views on the subject; here he simultaneously made the point that jihad against the British was unjustified whereas the Wahhabi jihad against the Sikhs was justified", page 102
14. "The English Government does not interfere with the Mohammedans in the practice of their religion. For this sole reason it is impossible that the idea of religious crusade should have been entertained.", page 102
15. "He went so far as to say that Mohammedans would never harm Christians since both had shared religious beliefs and were People of the Book.", page 108
16. "At that momentous crisis it was imperatively their duty—a duty enjoined by the precepts of our religion—to identify themselves heartily with the Christians and to espouse their cause, seeing that they have, like ourselves, been favoured with a revelation from heaven, and believe in the prophets, and hold sacred the word of God in His holy book, which is also an object of faith with us", page 109
17. "We in Hindoostan look upon the English as possessing evil disposition ... saying that they look upon Hindoostanees as animals, or beasts, and consider them low to a degree ... They do not understand us; and, moreover, I say in truth that we are so. I say without exaggeration and in all sincerity, that all Hindoostanees from the highest to the lowest, the richest and the poorest, the merchants and the labourers, the best educated and the most ignorant—we are, in comparison with the breeding and affability of the English, as dirty, unclean wild beasts in the presence of beautiful and worthy men ... I know my countrymen will take this as hard thing from me.", page 114
18. "Now, suppose that all English, and the whole English army, were to leave India, taking with them all their cannon and their splendid weapons and everything, then who would be rulers of India? Is it possible that under these circumstances two nations—the Mahomedans and the Hindus—could sit on the same throne and remain equal in power? Most certainly not. It is necessary that one of them should conquer the other and thrust it down. To hope that both could remain equal is to desire the impossible and the inconceivable. At the same time you must remember that although the number of Mahomedans is less than that of the Hindus, and although they contain far fewer people who have received a high English education, yet they must not be thought insignificant or weak. Probably they would be by themselves enough to maintain their own position. But suppose they were not. Then our Mussalman brothers, the Pathans, would come out as a swarm of locusts from their mountain valleys, and make rivers of blood to flow from their frontier in the north to the extreme end of Bengal. This thing—who, after the departure of the English, would be conquerors—would rest on the will of God. But until one nation had conquered the other and made it obedient, peace could not reign in the land. This conclusion is based on proofs so absolute that no one can deny it.", page 142
19. "...because the state of India is such that if foreign Powers attack her, no one has the power to oppose them. From this reasoning it follows of necessity that an empire not of any Indian race, but of foreigners, will be established in India. Now, will you please decide which of the nations of Europe you would like to rule over India? I ask if you would like Germany; whose subjects weep for heavy taxation and the stringency of their military service? Would you like the rule of France? Stop! I fancy you would perhaps like the rule of the Russians, who are very great friends of India and of Mahomedans, and under whom the Hindus will live in great comfort, and who will protect with the tenderest care the wealth and property which they have acquired under English rule? (Laughter.) Everybody knows something or other about these powerful kingdoms of Europe. Everyone will admit that their governments are far worse—nay, beyond comparison worse—than the British Government. It is, therefore, necessary that for the peace of India and for the progress of everything in India, the English Government should remain for many years—in fact forever!", page 143
20. "Our Hindu brothers of these provinces are leaving us and are joining the Bengalis. Then we ought to unite with that nation with whom we can unite. No Mahomedan can say that the English are not ‘People of the Book.’ No Mahomedan can deny this: that God has said that no people of other religions can be friends of Mahomedans except the Christians. He who had read the Koran and believes it, he can know that our nation cannot expect friendship and affection from any other people. At this time our nation is in a bad state as regards education and wealth, but God has given us the light of religion, and the Koran is present for our guidance, which has ordained them and us to be friends.", page 146
21. "It is pertinent to note that even as of March 1888, i.e., seventeen years before the Partition of Bengal in 1905 by Lord Curzon on religious lines, Syed Ahmed Khan was conscious of the growing Muslim demographic in Bengal and its implications for political assertion by Muslims, which, as we shall see, was a clear sign of things to come.", page 148
22. "I object to every Congress in any shape or form whatever which regards India as one nation.", page 149
23. "The Congress tried its best to court Muslims to participate in the national movement for political autonomy by even offering a compromise on the delicate issue of ban on cow slaughter in its Madras session of 1887. At this session, under the presidentship of Badruddin Tyabji, the Congress decided that questions of social reform that relate to a particular community, especially Muslims, would be decided by leaders of that community alone. While one may be tempted to see this as a sign of statesmanship on the part of the Congress and intransigence on the part of those representing the Muslim community, the fact of the matter is that the Congress had already embarked on the path of compromise by putting civilisational non-negotiables on the line, which served to further embolden the proponents of the Two-Nation Theory.", page 150
24. "From the brief history of Syed Ahmed Khan discussed above, it is clear that his formulation of the Two-Nation Theory was indeed the Dehlawite vision at work all along, couched in the European template of a nation-state.", page 151
