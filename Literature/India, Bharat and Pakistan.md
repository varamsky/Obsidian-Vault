## Fleeting Notes
1. "In popular discourse, the Partition of Bengal in 1905 on religious lines by the British is credited with sowing the seeds of the idea of Pakistan. This has created the false impression of communal harmony having existed between Hindus and Muslims prior to the employment of the so-called divide and rule policy by the British in 1905. While British motivations behind the Partition of Bengal and their subsequent hand in nurturing the idea of Pakistan must and will be examined in some detail, an exclusive focus on British machinations creates the erroneous notion of Hindus and Muslims being equal victims of British rule, drawing attention away from express attempts to restore Islamic rule over Bharat. It bears noting that an Anglocentric approach, which gives Middle Eastern coloniality a free pass in the context of Bharat’s Partition, is largely a product of the postcolonial school; this, therefore, reinforces the need for a decolonial approach to Bharat’s history to prevent the sugar-coating of facts with generous dollops of postcolonial secularisation.", page 25
2. "In the words of Saiyid Athar Abbas Rizvi, the following was Dehlawi’s conception of Islam:<br><br>The reason which prompted Allah to create the Islamic community originally was, according to Shah, mainly a political one. Allah wished that no religion superior to Islam should exist on earth and that Islamic law including those regarding different forms of punishment, should be adhered to wherever people lived a communal life. In this regard, he stated that the chief reason for fixing the blood-money for killing an infidel at half that of killing a Muslim was necessary in order to firmly establish the superiority of the latter; moreover, the slaughter of infidels, diminished evil amongst Muslims.", page 32
3. "As someone who considered Mahmud of Ghazni as Islam’s greatest ruler for having launched and sustained the first real conquest of northern Bharat,31 Dehlawi could not bear to watch the Mughal ‘empire’ under the licentious and un-Islamic Ahmad Shah Bahadur (1725–1775) survive only at the mercy of the Marathas. Here is a sample of his Islamic proposals to the Mughal dynast Ahmad Shah Bahadur, which went unheeded, much to Dehlawi’s angst:<br><br>Strict orders must be issued in all Islamic towns forbidding religious ceremonies publicly practised by the Infidels (such as Holi and ritual bathing in the Ganges). On the tenth of Muharram Shiís should not be allowed to go beyond the bounds of moderation and in the bazaars and streets neither should they be rude nor repeat stupid things (that is, recite tabarra or condemn the first three successors of Muhammad).<br><br>Notice how Shias, for whom Dehlawi had no love lost, could celebrate their festivals in public but in moderation, whereas Hindus had no right whatsoever to celebrate their festivals in public.", page 36
4. "According to Ayesha Jalal, Shariatullah, like Dehlawi, was an admirer of Arab culture, so much so that he ordered his followers to eat grasshoppers since they resembled the locusts eaten by his Arab co-religionists.", page 40
5. "Fortunately for him, his vehement call for practice of Islam in its purest form and for complete abandonment of Indian accretions which had arisen as a product of Muslims’ interactions with the infidels (namely the Hindus) found significant traction among Rohilla Muslims, who flocked to him in vast numbers.80 This was not surprising, considering that Najib-ud-Daula too was a Rohilla Pathan and the Third Battle of Panipat had taken place barely sixty years earlier. In case there existed an ‘Indian version’ of Islam and if there indeed was a Ganga–Jamuni tehzeeb, it was looked down upon and rejected by influential members of the Muslim community since the syncretism was largely the product of the Hindu ancestry of the converts. This means that what passes off as syncretism was and remains significantly the product of a nouveau convert unable to let go of his Hindu roots, which cannot be construed as Islam having acquired a distinct Bharatiya flavour or as revealing its malleability upon contact with Bharat. In any case, this ‘syncretic culture’ was given up by the masses, or at least by a significant number of them, at the first call to return to Islam 1.0, the din, the ‘true religion’. So much for ‘Indian Islam’.", page 45
6. "Thus began a series of bloody battles, starting with the Battle of Akora between the Wahhabis under Syed Shahid Ahmad Barelvi and the Sikhs under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, which would go on until the annexation of Punjab by the British in 1847—i.e., even after Ranjit Singh’s death in 1839 and after Barelvi’s death in 1831 at the Battle of Balakot", page 49
7. "This passage also underscores the historical significance of the surgical airstrikes undertaken by the Indian Air Force in Balakot in 2019 in response to the Pulwama suicide bombing. That the seeds for this terror network were sown by Barelvi in the 1800s needs to be pointed out, given the present-day tendency to look at certain incidents in isolation instead of identifying the existence of a thought continuum. Interestingly, the followers of Barelvi have not forgotten their history, whereas those who were the object of hatred of Barelvi and his mujahidin seem to suffer from a short memory. Ultimately, history tends to reward those with a long collective memory.", page 51
