Source: [[Valmiki]] : [Valmiki Ramayana in original Sanskrit hosted at valmiki.iitk](https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/sloka?field_kanda_tid=1&language=dv&field_sarga_value=1)

## My Thoughts
- The first सर्ग: / sarga, contains 100 श्लोक: / shlokas which acts as a summary of the entire वाल्मीकि रामायणम् / Valmiki Ramayanam
- In 1.1.39 and 1.1.40 i.e, प्रथम् सर्ग श्लोक: 39, 40 - We can see that as Bharat and people of Ayodhya came back again to persuade [[Rama]] to come to Ayodhya, he entered the [[Dandakaranya]] to avoid them and to fulfill his duty and to stick true to the word given by his father.
- In 1.1.41 we come to know about demon [[Viradha]] who was slain by [[Rama]]. He is also mentioned in [[Valmiki Ramayanam - Aranyakanda]] where is said to briefly kidnap Sita and is thus killed by [[Rama]]. - On Wikipedia, it says "that has been described as ("strongly prefiguring) Sita's later abduction by [[Ravana]]."
- In [[Dandakaranya]], [[Rama]] stayed in the hermitage of शरभङ्ग / [[Sarabhanga]] - 1.1.43
