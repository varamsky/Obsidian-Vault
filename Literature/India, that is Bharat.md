## Fleeting Notes
1. "Most colonised societies did not realise that their entire worldview had changed, for they could not see beyond political independence and aspired for freedom to govern themselves, albeit using the same values and institutions they had ‘inherited’ from the European coloniser. In other words, owing to coloniality, the vision of independence of most native elites was limited to the politico-economic sphere, namely decolonisation, but did not include decolonialisation because they accepted the European worldview on the all-important cultural front as well.", page 60
2. "..[[colonisation]] is the process, [[colonialism]] is the policy and [[coloniality]] is the mindset or the thought that underpins or drives colonialism.", page 63
3. "The European coloniser consciously believed in the ‘biological and structural superiority’ of his race, which, in the mind of the coloniser, distinguished him from the colonised. This belief, which was the premise of the colonial power structure and a ﬁgment of the coloniser’s self-important worldview, was legitimised as being ‘objective’, or ‘scientiﬁc’, or ‘rational’ and therefore, ‘natural’.", page 65
4. "Modernity and rationality, as introduced and employed by the European coloniser, therefore, represented (and still represent) the weaponisation of time and appropriation of the very idea of ‘reason’ by the European coloniser and his successor, the Western imperialist, who negate and deny the histories and the lived experiences of entire civilisations from the moment of their arrival.", page 65
5. "The cumulative eﬀect was the deep embedding of coloniality in the consciousness of the colonised society, so much so that it started believing that it had been defeated because of its cultural moorings. To the colonised and now colonialised native, it seemed that the only way to regain dignity was by adopting European culture and thought processes, which included the European way of achieving economic prosperity, that is, by exploiting nature. This disruption of the critical relationship between indigenous societies and nature came to aﬀect the entire world.", page 67
6. "This complex did not die with decolonisation but remains alive and kicking even today, just as coloniality is. After all, as scholars have identiﬁed, coloniality goes hand in hand with modernity/rationality and vice versa. As long as coloniality is alive, despite its outward proclamations of open-mindedness, dialogue and diversity, the colonial DNA of modernity and rationality will continue to actively resist and oust indigeneity. It will staunchly refuse to accord indigeneity the respect of an equal and will continue to use time and ‘reason’ as weapons to question the very relevance of the indigenous point of view, because the underlying premise—indigeneity is racially inferior—has not changed.", page 68
7. "The intended goal of European colonialism and the outcome was global cultural hegemony, which includes a subject that has become a sensitive one to broach due to deeply ingrained unconscious coloniality—the religious origins and impact of European colonialism on indigenous onto-epistemological structures and processes, simply put, their spirituality and faith.", page 71
8. "..which meant that what was valid within the Christian worldview was deemed ‘good’ for the entire world, and those that did not conform had to convert or perish. Her views are certainly supported by the fact that a Papal Bull called Inter Caetera was issued by [[Pope Alexander VI]] in 1493, which authorised Spain and Portugal to colonise, convert and enslave non-Christians.", page 73
9. "..in the eyes of the Christian European coloniser, he was not merely ‘saving’ the soul of a non-Christian inﬁdel or idolator but was breathing soul into a Satan-worshipping subhuman, an animal, through his Christianising and civilising European touch. If this healing touch was resisted, the subhuman had to be put down ruthlessly like a beast.", page 81
10. "In stark contrast to the benevolent connotations imputed to humanism, the literature reveals, as we shall see, that it has the direct eﬀect of placing humans over and above nature, which is the product of coloniality.", page 88
11. "This enumeration of roles was based on the realisation of the ‘vast web of humankind’s cyclical interrelationships with the elements, the earth and all that lives upon the land’. Their relationship with the earth was one of ‘reciprocal appropriation’, that is, to give and receive, ‘in which humans participate(d) in the landscape while at the same time they incorporate(d) the landscape and its inhabitants into the most fundamental human experience and understanding’. To them, nature was never meant to be isolated from humans and studied in a silo. As opposed to being an object of clinical study, it was meant to be lived with in harmony. This ‘environmental morality’ instilled humility and informed both inter-community relations as well as their collective relationship with nature", page 89
12. "On a related note, perhaps followers of certain Indic schools of philosophy can relate to the beliefs of the Siouanculture as depicted by Brown in his book The Sacred Pipe. The Siouan people believed that the whole of creation was essentially one and that all parts within the whole were related. What was particularly interesting was the way the Sioux referred to each other in relational terms. For instance, an old woman would be addressed as ‘mother’ and a much older woman as ‘grandmother’. Such an approach to human relations is a direct corollary of the community’s spiritual attitude to nature.", page 89
13. "When the European coloniser set foot on the American soil, he was staunchly rooted in the Christian belief that humans were above other creatures since humans (read the White Christian) were ‘beings’ because they possessed souls, and the rest were ‘non-beings’ because they had no souls. Christianity placed the ‘human being’, preferably the Christian White European, above the rest of creation, thereby furthering the belief that nature existed solely for the ‘pursuit of his happiness’ and his ‘manifest destiny’. The diﬀerence in the attitudes of the Native Americans and the coloniser towards nature could not have been starker. One worshipped nature and saw himself as a part of it, while the other put himself above nature and sought to enjoy its plenty as a matter of divinely ordained right. It is no surprise then that ‘humanism’ and ‘materialism’ are the direct consequences of the coloniser’s OET, which, among other things, gave birth to a Cartesian dualistic approach, whose distinction between subject/mind and object/body placed human beings above nature. This explains the coloniser’s approach to ‘development’ as well. Simply put, coloniality objectiﬁed nature apart from dehumanising vast swathes of humanity.", page 90
14. "..despite the diversity of human experiences and natural conditions encountered by the coloniser in diﬀerent parts of the world, he was convinced beyond doubt that the same model of economic growth, industrialisation and development could be replicated uniformly across the world without exception. This once again reﬂects the homogenising intent and eﬀect of the modernity/rationality complex of European coloniality.", page 91
15. "This perhaps explains why the colonised territory was primarily viewed as a resource for exploitation, with its inhabitants being treated as subhuman, dark, idol-worshipping, soulless, heathen irritants who obstructed the coloniser’s unhindereduse of nature.", page 92
16. "The expectation that every religion must have a ‘book’ as its sole authority that captured its tenets was essentially a Christian expectation, which was imposed on the onto-epistemological systems of native communities in order to delegitimise or Christianise their faiths. The absence of a ‘book’ not only rendered their faiths but also their entire history legendary and mythical in the eyes of the coloniser.", page 94
17. "The Christian coloniser was acutely alive to the fact that language captured a culture’s journey and reﬂected it through its stories, idioms, proverbs and usages, which connected the speaker with the collective past. To remove traces of the past in the language of the future, native children were forbidden from speaking in their languages, a practice that continues in English-medium schools to this day.", page 95
18. "There even exist recorded instances of European legislators in colonial South Africa exhorting the South African government to ‘win the ﬁght against the non-White in the classroom instead of losing it in the battleﬁeld’.", page 96
19. "One ‘scientiﬁc’ reason that was oﬀered to explain the disparity in curricula was the coloniser’s perception of a given colonised community’s aptitude for knowledge based on race, the pecking order being Whites, Indians, Coloureds and Black Africans. The premise of this racial stratiﬁcation was that Africans could not master ‘bookish subjects’ and therefore, even if given an opportunity, were incapable of competing with Europeans. Accordingly, they were oﬀered only vocational or industrial training. On the rare occasion that ‘exceptional’ African students were oﬀered access to an ‘academic curriculum’, the medium of instruction was English, proﬁciency in which was integral to academic success.", page 98
20. "..there was an allocation of worlds between the monks and the clergy; the monks would lead the rest of the ‘ﬂock’ in the other world, the Church and its clergy would lead the ﬂock, including the rulers, in the earthly world akin to shepherds. In eﬀect, the priests became conduits to salvation and God since they were the true servants of God. This is the essence of the Christian doctrine extra ecclesiam nulla salus—all salvation is through Christ and Christ can be reached only through the Church, and therefore there is no salvation outside the Church.", page 112
