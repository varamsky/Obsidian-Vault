## My Thoughts
1. "It must be emphasized.....rise of national consciousness." - Signs of coloniality in his thoughts that the colonisers gave India identity of a united nation!? - but he mentioned political unity and not cultural which might be true ... not sure.
2. ""A definite pattern....theatres of war." - Really? I know that Gandhi promoted the idea of Indians fighting in the World Wars. But were the princely states' rulers also advocates of this move?"
3. "Britain claimed...announcement of 20 August 1917:" - Contrasting language as opposed to the previous highlights where he suggested that India as an entity was formed by the British
4. "The policy...British Empire." - Maybe the British govt. realised that the Indians are colonised enough to slowly give them control of their destiny so that they continue to believe that they rule themselves but in reality the British Christian colonial ideology would rule us all.
5. "The authors...polity of India." - In other words the British realised that these 'slaves' now truly feel that it is their duty to serve the British therefore they were ready to included them into the administration.


## Fleeting Notes
1. "It must be emphasized that' not even in the palmiest days of the Hindu and Moghul empires did the entire country come under one political umbrella. No greater achievement can be credited to the British than that they brought about India's enduring political consolidation. But for this accomplishment and the rise of national consciousness.", page 11
2. "After the disintegration of the Moghul Empire, the only power which seemed likely to step into the breach was the Mahrattas. Shivaji had laid the foundations of a mighty kingdom; but this pioneer of a resurgent Hindu empire had left no competent successor. After Shivaji's death, the Peshwas (chief ministers to the ruler) gradually took over control. In the beginning they showed promise of becoming the rallying force of the great Mahratta Confederacy. But theirs was the story of the Hindu and Moghul empires over again. Intrigue and corruption at the Peshwa's Court and perpetual wars between the Scindia and the Holkar disrupted Mahratta unity. The Mahratta armies were tax-collectors by force and showed no discrimination between the Hindu and the Muslim. The imposition of chauth and sardeshmukhi in conquered areas and the collection of these exactions by the Mulkgiri forces brought upon them the sullen hatred of the people.", page 11
3. "...his greatest contribution was the institution of a policy of subsidiary alliances with the Indian rulers. Under this system, the State accepting subsidiary alliance was to make no wars and to carry on no negotiations with any other State without the Company's knowledge and consent; the bigger States were to maintain armies commanded by British officers for 'the preservation of the public peace' and their rulers were to cede certain territories for the upkeep of these forces; the smaller States were to pay a tribute to the Company. In return, the Company was to protect them, one and all, against external aggression and internal rebellion. A British Resident was also installed in every State that accepted the subsidiary alliance.", page 14
4. "When Wellesley was recalled in 1805 the British dominion had expanded considerably. He had successfully overcome Tippu, whose defeat and death in 1799 removed a major threat to the British Empire. He practically eliminated the French influence in India. Besides, he brought many States under subsidiary alliances, the notable ones being Hyderabad, Travancore, Mysore , Baroda and Gwalior.", page 14
5. "The Indian rulers for the most part, not only remained aloof from the uprising but in certain cases extended active assistance to the British in suppressing it. Lord Canning gratefully acknowledged the role of the States as 'breakwaters in the storm which would have swept over us in one great wave.' 'Where should we have been,' enquired Elphinstone with characteristic frankness, 'if Scindia, the Nizam and the Sikh chiefs etc. had been annexed, the subordinate presidencies abolished, the whole army thrown into one and the revenue system brought into one mould?' The realization that the States could play a vital role as one of the bulwarks of British rule led to a radical change of policy, which found expression in Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858", page 21
6. "A definite pattern of the Government of India's relationship with the States in all its details had been developed by the time the First World War broke out in August 1914. The rulers rallied to fight for the Empire in its hour of peril, offering both their personal services and the resources of their States. Not only did they help Britain lavishly with men, material and money, but some of them even served as officers in different theatres of war.", page 26
7. "Britain claimed to be fighting a war to defend freedom and democracy; but the system of government by which she continued to hold India in imperial thrall was clearly at variance with her professed aims. The British Government recognized that the situation needed new handling and that there was an imperative and urgent need for a new policy. Accordingly, Edwin Samuel Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, made the historic announcement of 20 August 1917:", page 26
8. "The policy of His Majesty's Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of the increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and the gradual development of self-governing institutions with a view to the progressive realization of responsible government in India as an integral part of the British Empire.", page 28
9. "The authors of the joint report paid glowing tributes to the princes for the part played by them in the war, which had demonstrated their immense value as part of the polity of India.", page 28
10. "The Chamber of Princes was brought into being by a Royal Proclamation on 8 February 1921. The ceremony of inauguration was performed by the Duke of Connaught, on behalf of the King- Emperor, in the Dewan-i-am of the Moghul Red Fort in Delhi. The Chamber was to be a deliberative, consultative and advisory body. The Proclamation defined its limits: My Viceroy will take its counsel freely in matters relating to the territories of Indian States generally and in matters that affect these territories jointly with British India or with the rest of my Empire. It will have no concern with the internal affairs of individual States or their Rulers or with the relations of individual States with my Government, while the existing rights of these States and their freedom of action will in no way be prejudiced or impaired.", page 33
11. "...therefore the States could not be compelled to transfer to a third party their loyalty to the British Crown. On the question of the limitation of paramountcy, the Butler Committee disagreed with the views propounded by Sir Leslie Scott. The Committee held that the relationship of the paramount power with the States was not merely a contractual relationship resting on treaties made more than a century ago, but that it was a living, growing relationship shaped by circumstances and policy, resting on a mixture of history, theory and modern fact. It was no t historically correct to assume that when the States came into contact with the British power they were independent, each possessed of full sovereignty and of a status which a modern international lawyer would hold to be governed by the rules of international law. In fact, none of the States had ever had international status. Nearly all of them were subordinate or tributary to the Moghul Empire, the Mahratta Confederacy or the Sikh Kingdom, and were dependent on them. Some were rescued by the British and others were created by them. The Committee refused to define paramountcy but asserted that (paramountcy must remain paramount; it must fulfill its obligations, defining or adapting itself according to the shifting necessities of the time and the progressive development of the States.'", page 41
12. "The communal situation by this time had considerably deteriorated and no understanding could be brought about between the two major communities. In January 1940, Jinnah declared that the Hindus and the Muslims formed two separate nations, and that both must share the governance of their common motherland. Three months later, at the Lahore session of the Muslim League, he declared that the Muslim nation must have a separate independent State of Pakistan. In all subsequent discussions on constitutional advance this attitude on the part of Jinnah and the Muslim League was the dominant factor.", page 80
