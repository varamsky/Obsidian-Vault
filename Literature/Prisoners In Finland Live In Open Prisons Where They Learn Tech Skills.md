## My Thoughts
- [[Why do we have prisons?]]

## Fleeting Notes
- A man charged with murder is studying for a career in IT. In the [[Open Prisons]] of Finland, the prisoners don't have live in cells but dormitories. Inmates come and go between university campuses and the dormitories in their own cars.
- "...we have this kind of normality principle that prisoners should be treated equally even thought they are prisoners. But they should have access to the same services and rights as other citizens."
- "A Finn here. To clear up any confusion: *this is NOT how all our prisons work. We still have ”normal” prisons for dangerous criminals. This is an ”open” variant, that usually houses criminals with less severe convictions, and those that are finishing their sentences*. Matti here has served many years in a normal prison, before being transferred to his current prison. Before that **professionals have studied him completely to decide if he’s ready to rehabilitate into the society. I’d guess most murderers don’t pass that test**...." - pointed out by a comment on the video.
- "A re-imagining of what prison looks like here started nearly 70 years ago.."
